    "By now, we have learned all that we need to know about the definition and the behavior of a class. The concepts of inheritance and polymorphism taught us how to create dependent classes out of a base class. While inheritance represents a relationship between classes, there are situations where there are relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main class relationships we need to know:\n",
    "1. \"IS A\" which constitues inheritance\n",
    "2. \"PART OF\" In this relationship, one class object is a component of another class object.\n",
    "3. \"HAS A\" Class A and class B have a has-a relationship if one or both need the otherâ€™s object to perform an operation, but both class objects can exist independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, association is the common term for both the has-a and part-of relationships but is not limited to these. "
