# educative-python-for-programmers
Coursework completed while working through educative's Python for Programmers learning path. I am taking this learning path to strengthen my skills as a software developer in Python. If you see traceback errors in some of the notebooks don't be alarmed, read a little closer, they are displayed purposefully as a means of explanation for different modules and concepts!

This course covers 4 modules that span dozens of lessons, the overarching concepts include:
* Learning the fundamentals of Python programming
* Learning to write cleaner code in Python with Object Oriented Programming
* Learning how to efficiently use Python's built-in data structures
* Mastering advanced concepts in Python including modules and web-related tasks
