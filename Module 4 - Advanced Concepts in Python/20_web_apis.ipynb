      "Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.\n"

      "Python (prononcé /pi.tɔ̃/) est un langage de programmation interprété, multi-paradigme et multiplateformes. Il favorise la programmation impérative structurée, fonctionnelle et orientée objet. Il est doté d'un typage dynamique fort, d'une gestion automatique de la mémoire par ramasse-miettes et d'un système de gestion d'exceptions ; il est ainsi similaire à Perl, Ruby, Scheme, Smalltalk et Tcl.\n",
      "Le langage Python est placé sous une licence libre proche de la licence BSD et fonctionne sur la plupart des plates-formes informatiques, des smartphones aux ordinateurs centraux, de Windows à Unix avec notamment GNU/Linux en passant par macOS, ou encore Android, iOS, et peut aussi être traduit en Java ou .NET. Il est conçu pour optimiser la productivité des programmeurs en offrant des outils de haut niveau et une syntaxe simple à utiliser.\n",
      "Il est également apprécié par certains pédagogues qui y trouvent un langage où la syntaxe, clairement séparée des mécanismes de bas niveau, permet une initiation aisée aux concepts de base de la programmation.\n"
