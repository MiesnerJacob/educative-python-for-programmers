    "The threading module allows your program to run multiple operations at once. Threads work best with I/O operations, but if you have a CPU intensive task, you will want to use the multiprocessing module instead. The reason for this is that Python has the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that basically makes all threads run inside of one master thread. Because of this, when you go to run multiple CPU intensive operations with threads, you may find that it actually runs slower. So we will be focusing on what threads do best: I/O operations!"
