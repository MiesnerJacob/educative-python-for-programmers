    "Asyncio is built around the event loop. An event loops waits for something to happen then acts on the event. It handles I/O and ssystem events. An event loop basically says when A happenns execute B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of asyncio is the coroutine which is a special function that gives control up to the caller without losing its statre. One of the big benefiots over threads is that they dont use much memory. When you call a coroutine function it doesn't execute right away, instead it will return a coroutine object that you can pass to the event loop to have it executed either immediately or later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future is basically an object that represents the result of work that hasn’t completed. A Task is a wrapper for a coroutine and a subclass of Future.\n",
    "\n",
